  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img id="me" src="/images/me.jpg">
  <p>I am a professional photographer that specializes in birds and fish. I began my love for these creatures way back in middle school when our 
      class went to the zoo to see the animals. We went in a bird cage and I got a little lost along the way. My teacher wasn't very responsible so 
      I ended up getting stuck in the bird cage overnight. At first I was afraid of the birds, but I soon learned to make friends with them. They became 
      my best friends throughout the years that I spent in that cage. They taught me many useful things, including how to appreciate fish, my other great passion. 
      I love looking at fish and taking their pictures. I believe that everyone should be able to appreciate their beauty. 
  </p>

  <p>
      I photograph pictures of fish and birds. I also am capable of taking pictures of other things too, I guess.
